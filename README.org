* A starting place for working with platformio and mysensors
A great environment for developing one's own sensors:
  - https://www.mysensors.org
  
A great environment for IoT development:
  - https://www.platformio.org

* Getting it working
- Do you have platformio installed?
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Still python2-only
  pip install plaformio
  #+END_SRC
Platformio is the single requirement. Unfortunately, version 3.5.3 depends in
a version of requests that has a vulnerability. Consider a virtual environment
for it please. Later versions may introduce dependency-hell.

- Do you have everything hooked up?
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone  https://github.com/oneyb/template-mysensors-platformio.git some-project-name
  cd some-project-name
  pio run -t upload
  #+END_SRC
Of course that may build and upload but I doubt it will just work. This stuff is a little complex.

For less popular external libraries that platformio doesn't find, create a ~lib/~ directory, and put them in there. Platformio will pick them up.


* Further help
  - check your devices that are plugged in:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ls -al /dev/tty*
#+END_SRC
    - consider using this ansible playbook: https://github.com/oneyb/rpi-embed-dev/blob/master/install-platformio.yaml
  - Attempt to compile and upload firmware (assuming you have the [[https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/faq.html#faq-udev-rules][udev rules]] set up and a USB plugged in with an upload_port of ~/dev/ttyACM0~, otherwise adjust [[file:platformio.ini][platformio.ini]]):
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pio run -t upload
#+END_SRC
  - Start somewhere to help yourself:
