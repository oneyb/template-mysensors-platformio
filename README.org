* A starting place for working with platformio and mysensors
A great environment for developing one's own sensors:
  - https://www.mysensors.org
  
A great environment for IoT development:
  - https://www.platformio.org

* Getting it working
Do you have everything hooked up?
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone  https://github.com/oneyb/template-mysensors-platformio.git some-project-name
cd some-project-name
pio run -t upload
#+END_SRC
Of course that may build and upload but I doubt it will just work.

For less popular external libraries, create a ~lib/~ directory, and put them in there. Platformio will pick them up.


* Further help
  - consider this ansible playbook: https://github.com/oneyb/rpi-ap-ha/blob/master/install-platformio.yaml
  - Compile and upload firmware (assuming you have the [[https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/faq.html#faq-udev-rules][udev rules]] set up and a USB plugged in with an upload_port of ~/dev/ttyACM0~, otherwise adjust [[file:platformio.ini][platformio.ini]]):
    - ~pio run -t upload~
  - Check the output of your sensor on your MySensors gateway+controller
  - Be happy if it works. Accept the challenge if it doesn't ;).
  - Start somewhere:
    - https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest
    - https://www.mysensors.org/about/iot
